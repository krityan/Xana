# Xana
Text Based Adventure Game in C#

Xana is just a codename I gave this project, the actual name is undecided.

This game is set in a fantasy world currently known as "Xana", following the story of a young boy whose Mother was killed in a raid whilst his father and brother were off working for the army. The boy of 17 follows them to the nearby city planning to join them, but things don't go to plan.
